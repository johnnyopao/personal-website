# Personal Website for www.johnnyopao.com

A single page site as an entry point to my other projects and social links.

## Developing locally
Run the command

```
npm start
```

### Why the node server?
It's only for local development. With a dev server I can auto reload and serve up the page under localhost. This is needed so typekit has a hostname to whitelist the fonts under.

## TODO
* Add a short bio snippet
* Deploy script
  * Needs to invalidate cache
* Configure naked domain
